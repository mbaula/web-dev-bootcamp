          <p>
            I am currently studing Mechatronics Engineering at the University
            of Waterloo. I'm going to start 2nd year this Fall of 2020.
            Mechatronics students often pursue careers in product and software
            design, technology analysis, program coordination, and more.
            I want to delve deeper into the software path, more specifically
            web development and data science :) !

            I know Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, C++ Java, and Assembly. I'm
            familiar with several frameworks such as NumPy, Seaborn, Plotly,
            Cufflinks, Matplotlib, and more. Currently delving deeper into
            web frameworks more specifically Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB,
            Mongoose, and React.js
